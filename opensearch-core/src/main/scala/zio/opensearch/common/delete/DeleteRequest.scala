/*
 * Removes a document from the index.
 * For more info refers to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/master/docs-delete.html
 *
 * @param index The name of the index
 * @param id The document ID
 * @param errorTrace When set to `true` OpenSearch will include the full stack trace of errors
 * when they occur.
 * @server_default false

 * @param filterPath Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
 * returned by OpenSearch.

 * @param human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
 * For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
 * `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
 * readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
 * only by machines.
 * @server_default false

 * @param pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
 * this option for debugging only.
 * @server_default false

 * @param ifPrimaryTerm only perform the delete operation if the last operation that has changed the document has the specified primary term
 * @param ifSeqNo only perform the delete operation if the last operation that has changed the document has the specified sequence number
 * @param refresh If `true` then refresh the affected shards to make this operation visible to search, if `wait_for` then wait for a refresh to make this operation visible to search, if `false` (the default) then do nothing with refreshes.
 * @param routing Specific routing value
 * @param timeout Explicit operation timeout
 * @param version Explicit version number for concurrency control
 * @param versionType Specific version type
 * @param waitForActiveShards Sets the number of shard copies that must be active before proceeding with the delete operation. Defaults to 1, meaning the primary shard only. Set to `all` for all shard copies, otherwise set to any non-negative value less than or equal to the total number of copies for the shard (number of replicas + 1)
